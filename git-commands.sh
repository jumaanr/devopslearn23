#Getting help
git help #Get the help and command palatte

#Git start-up
git init #Init a Git Repository, this will create the directory structure .git hidden directory
git status #Check the branches , Commits and Untracked files
git add myFile.json #Stage a file for commit ready
git commit -m "Added first story" #commit all staged files with a useful comment
git config user.name "sarah" #add a user for commit, so all commits are recorded in the name of the author
git config user.email "sarah@example.com"  #add user's email address who perform commit

git config --global user.name "Jumaan Rimzy"
git config --global user.email "jumaanr@outlook.com"

git config --list #shows the current values
git commit #when you open this command without any options , opens a text editor - here you provide a commit message 
git add .  #stage all the files in working area

#Restore Recover and Remove
#Even if you commit or staged a file a copy will be saved, so you can restore the file
git restore myFile.json
git restore --staged myFile.json #remove a file from staging area
git rm notes.txt -f/--cached  #remove a tracked file , --cached option will retain the file in directory, -f option will delete file permanently.
# Still we can see the file untracked state , to ignore this file permanently add that file name to a file called .gitignore
echo "myFile.json" >> .gitignore
cat .ignore

#Git Log - Checking commit histor
git log  # check the details of commit history
git log --oneline # get a short description of commit history
git log --name-only #get the list of changed files and their authors/modifires
git log -n <number>  #get -n number of the latest (reverse chrono order) record of commit history , to get the latest value is '1'
git log --graph --decorate #to see previous commit history along with the branch they were committed on

#Git Branching
git branch newBranch  #Create a new branch
git checkout newBranch #Switch branches
git checkout -b newBranch2  #Create a new branch and immediately switch to the new branch
git branch -d newBranch2 #Delete a branch 
git branch #list all the branches currently you have

#Git Mergin a Branch
git checkout master  #checkout to master branch
git merge feature/signup #perform the merge 

#Working with Remote Repositories (GitHub)--------------------------------------------------

#git remote add origin <Connection_String> ,Add a remote repo for a local project.This is a name for the remote, and also can have multiple remote repositories
git remote add origin https://..../../[name].git 
git remote -v  #List all remote repositories
git remote show # show remote repositories
git push origin master  # git push <aliasOfRemoteRepo> <CurrentBranch/BranchName>  , Push the data to remote repo
git clone http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog  #clone a remote repository locally and work on it
#git clone [ssh link] 
#Once we cloned , we dont have to add the repository using git remote add command. Because in the clonning it automatically get added
git push -u origin master #creates a link between local master and remote master branches 
#Whenever new data added to remote master branch , automatically the local master branch will pull
#the data from there so next time, you dont have to specify git push origin master , instead perform
git push 

#Git Pull Request
#When working in collaboration , directly pushing the commits to the main branch is not advised
#instead perform the commits in sub-branch and then create a pull request
#Reviewers will review and approvers will aprove the code and merge the changes to main branch
#After than initiate a pull to fetch and merge the changes directly into our local master branch

#Fetching and Pulling
git fetch origin master #Update orgin/master branch in our local repository
git merge orgin/master #now we have an updated local master
git branch -a # view all the branches both local and remote
git pull origin master # We can fetch and merge remote changes directly into our local master branch. No need to perform fetch and merge seperately. 

#Forking
# step 1 : create a fork by clicking 'Fork' button - now under explore you can see a seperate copy 
# step 2 : clone the forked repository directly to your system
# step 3 : make changes (add , commit ) and push the changes to master branch of forked repository
# step 4 : login to GitUI and create a PR from forked repo to original repo
# step 5 : owners or admins will review and approve and merge the pull request finally

#Rebasing------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#have not sent a pull request, but wanted to keep yourself caught up with updates 
#Question ? Whats the difference between pull (fetch + merge ) and rebasing ?
# Pull request is updating changes from remote repository to your master branch, then rebase help to update your current branch with the master branch

git rebase master  #rebase your branch on top of master branch
git rebase -i HEAD~4 # telling Git that we want to interactively rebase last 4 commits
git cherry-pick b1fbc37 #Cherry pick a certain commit and add it your working branch , hash of the commit is given

#Resetting and Reverting---------------------------------------------------------------------------
git revert 8ad5d #reverse all changes made on a specific commit, useful for undoing changes ; can go back 
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # revert the previous 1 commit back ( denoted by number ) while keeping all the changes were made ; Can go back
git status #we still have access to the changes were made by resetted commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1 #the n number of commits (n=1) will be resetted without keeping changes made, you will lose the changes made ; no go back 
git status # we cannot see the changes made in previous commit

#Stashing
git stash #stash ( save ) all the changes in working area without commit. The modifications in working area get added to stash ( a pile) ?
git stash pop #get the changes back into the working area
git stash list #list all the stashes piled up on the stash
git stash show 	stash@{1} #see the content of certain stash
git stash pop stash@{1} #pop a specific stash instead of the last one
#Usually latest stash takes the index 0 , its a stack/pile (latest on the top) 

#Reflog
git reflog #shows all the actions that have been taken on the repo
#How to recover using reflog : Refer the reflog and perform a hard reset to the point where you want to restore
git reset --hard 8ad5
#git log only gives you the history of events, but reflog gives you all the states of the repository including merges, resets , reverts etc.
